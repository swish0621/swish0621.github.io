# Content-Based Recommendation System


## Vision Statement
This project aims to provide hands-on experience with popular technology stacks while also producing a portfolio-worthy project. It will deepen my understanding of recommendation systems and practical machine learning workflows.

## Motivation
Recommendation systems are widely used throughout industry, driving applications from streaming services to e-commerce platforms. This project was chosen to gain practical experience in building such systems, enhancing my technical skills, and broadening my understanding of real-world applications.

## Objectives

### 1. Dataset Selection
- Obtain a dataset with a minimum of **1,000 items** and **5+ attributes** (currently planning to use a movie dataset).  
- Clean and preprocess the dataset.  
- Transform item attributes into vector representations for use in similarity calculations.

### 2. Feature Representation & Similarity
- Implement **at least two similarity measures** (e.g., Euclidean distance and Cosine similarity).  
- Compare and evaluate the effectiveness of each similarity measure.  
- Validate correctness through small example queries.

### 3. Recommendation System
- Return the **top 5 most similar items** for a single item or a user's history.  
- Ensure reasonable runtime for any potential input.

### 4. FastAPI & SQLite Implementation
- Integrate the recommendation system into a **FastAPI** backend.  
- Implement at least **two endpoints** (e.g., `/recommend/{item_id}` and `/health`).  
- Connect FastAPI to a **SQLite database** for storing item data and any user history.

### 5. Measurable Success
- Evaluate recommendations using **at least one metric** (e.g., precision@5).  
- Ensure consistency of recommendations across multiple queries.  
- Report quantitative evaluation results.

### 6. Final Deliverable & Documentation
- Provide a **documented implementation** of Python and FastAPI components with setup instructions.  
- Include a **detailed README and project report** explaining the system, evaluation, and results.


## Tools & Technologies
- **Python 3.10+** — primary programming language for recommendation logic.
- **FastAPI** — lightweight web framework to expose the recommendation system via API.
- **SQLite** — relational database for storing item data and user interactions.
- **Jinja2 Templates** — for minimal frontend UI served via FastAPI.
- **Pandas / NumPy / Scikit-learn** — for data preprocessing, vectorization, and similarity calculations.


## Risks to Completion & Mitigation

- **Unfamiliarity with FastAPI and SQLite**  
  - *Mitigation:* Allocate time early in the project to complete tutorials and practice exercises.

- **Balancing workload with other classes and career commitments**  
  - *Mitigation:* Use a **weekly schedule** with milestones, prioritizing core functionality first.

- **Scope Creep**  
  - *Mitigation:* Define a **minimum viable product (MVP)**; additional features are optional if time allows.

- **Dataset Availability and Quality**  
  - *Mitigation:* Use publicly available datasets (e.g., Kaggle) and perform early preprocessing.

## Assessments
The finished project should:  
- Provide a **functional FastAPI backend** capable of returning recommendations through at least one endpoint.  
- Use a **SQLite database** to store item data and user interactions.  
- Generate **accurate recommendations** based on a single input or user history.  
- Include **clear documentation** to install, run, and test the system.
