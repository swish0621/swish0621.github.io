# Weekly Updates

This page is where Agile-style weekly updates are available for my projects. 

## Week 1

Last week, I began brainstorming ideas for the semester project that would fit within the required timeframe while still pushing my knowledge and abilities. The idea I am considering is a **content-based recommendation system**. This concept came to me while doing work for another class, where we were asked to look for algorithms that we encounter in our day-to-day lives. Recommendation systems are found in almost everything we do â€” from Netflix to social media to shopping websites, we are constantly being recommended things based on our previous history. I believe implementing such a tool will give me a deeper look into something that nearly every company uses while advancing my current skill set and creating a strong showcase project for my GitHub.

This week, I plan to build a mapping of the tools and frameworks I will need to create in order to solidify this project. As of now, the tools I have in mind are aligned with some of the tech stacks suggested by Professor Guinn, incorporating **Python** as the backend language, **FastAPI** to build a web interface, and **SQLite** for data storage.

The roadblocks I currently face are mainly my unfamiliarity with SQLite and FastAPI, which will require some research to gain proficiency. I have some experience with **Flask** from another class and have used **MySQL** as well, so researching the similarities and differences between the tools I know and the ones I plan to use will be necessary to progress forward.

Now that I am moving out of simple brainstorming and into building a plan, I need to create a documented roadmap of the steps required to make this project a reality. I work best when I have a **broken-down list of actionable steps** to complete the project.
