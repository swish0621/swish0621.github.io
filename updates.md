# Weekly Updates

This page is where Agile-style weekly updates are available for my projects. 

## Week 1
---

Last week, I began brainstorming ideas for the semester project that would fit within the required timeframe while still pushing my knowledge and abilities. The idea I am considering is a **content-based recommendation system**. This concept came to me while doing work for another class, where we were asked to look for algorithms that we encounter in our day-to-day lives. Recommendation systems are found in almost everything we do â€” from Netflix to social media to shopping websites, we are constantly being recommended things based on our previous history. I believe implementing such a tool will give me a deeper look into something that nearly every company uses while advancing my current skill set and creating a strong showcase project for my GitHub.

This week, I plan to build a mapping of the tools and frameworks I will need to create in order to solidify this project. As of now, the tools I have in mind are aligned with some of the tech stacks suggested by Professor Guinn, incorporating **Python** as the backend language, **FastAPI** to build a web interface, and **SQLite** for data storage.

The roadblocks I currently face are mainly my unfamiliarity with SQLite and FastAPI, which will require some research to gain proficiency. I have some experience with **Flask** from another class and have used **MySQL** as well, so researching the similarities and differences between the tools I know and the ones I plan to use will be necessary to progress forward.

Now that I am moving out of simple brainstorming and into building a plan, I need to create a documented roadmap of the steps required to make this project a reality. I work best when I have a **broken-down list of actionable steps** to complete the project.

## Week 2

Last week, I created my project proposal, which included a more itemized outline of the project. This will help me formulate a schedule I can adhere to in order to complete the project. I also spent some time learning about and working on the setup of my GitHub.io page. I created the repository for the project and began the setup process.

This week, I will begin at the top of my to-do list, search for a dataset that meets the criteria outlined in my proposal, and begin preprocessing the data. I would also like to create the file structure within the repository.

The main obstacles in my way currently are the workloads of my other classes. In order to combat this, I am planning to try to get the assignments for my other classes done earlier in the week so I can spend additional time on this project.

The process I used last week was suboptimal, as other classes took more time than expected and left me with less time to dedicate to this project. I think the approach outlined above will help me address this issue.
