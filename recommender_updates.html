    <h1>Content-Based-Recommendation-System</h1>
    <h2>Weekly Project Updates</h2>

    <div class="update-card">
      <h2>Week 1</h2>
      <p>
        <ul>
          <li>Last week: I began brainstorming ideas for the semester project that would fit within the required timeframe while still pushing my knowledge and abilities. The idea I am considering is a content-based recommendation system. This concept came to me while doing work for another class, where we were asked to look for algorithms that we encounter in our day-to-day lives. Recommendation systems are found in almost everything we do â€” from Netflix to social media to shopping websites, we are constantly being recommended things based on our previous history. I believe implementing such a tool will give me a deeper look into something that nearly every company uses while advancing my current skill set and creating a strong showcase project for my GitHub.</li><br>
          <li> This week: This week, I plan to build a mapping of the tools and frameworks I will need to create in order to solidify this project. As of now, the tools I have in mind are aligned with some of the tech stacks suggested by Professor Guinn, incorporating Python as the backend language, FastAPI to build a web interface, and SQLite for data storage.</li><br>
          <li>Obstacles: The roadblocks I currently face are mainly my unfamiliarity with SQLite and FastAPI, which will require some research to gain proficiency. I have some experience with Flask from another class and have used MySQL as well, so researching the similarities and differences between the tools I know and the ones I plan to use will be necessary to progress forward.</li><br>
          <li>Work process: Now that I am moving out of simple brainstorming and into building a plan, I need to create a documented roadmap of the steps required to make this project a reality. I work best when I have a broken-down list of actionable steps to complete the project.</li>
        </ul>

      <h2>Week 2</h2>
      <p>
        <ul>
          <li>Last week: I created my project proposal, which included a more itemized outline of the project. This will help me formulate a schedule I can adhere to in order to complete the project. I also spent some time learning about and working on the setup of my GitHub.io page. I created the repository for the project and began the setup process.</li><br>
          <li> This week: I will begin at the top of my to-do list, search for a dataset that meets the criteria outlined in my proposal, and begin preprocessing the data. I would also like to create the file structure within the repository.</li><br>
          <li>Obstacles: The main obstacles in my way currently are the workloads of my other classes. In order to combat this, I am planning to try to get the assignments for my other classes done earlier in the week so I can spend additional time on this project.</li><br>
          <li>Work process: The process I used last week was suboptimal, as other classes took more time than expected and left me with less time to dedicate to this project. I think the approach outlined above will help me address this issue.</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
    </div>
        <div class="update-card">
      <h2>Week 3</h2>
      <p>
        <ul>
          <li>Last week: I researched the scikit-learn library, learning about some of the applications that it has for use in my Content-Based-Recommendation-System project. At this stage I focused on utilizing scikit to vectorize the keyword data associated with movies to be used later for similarity comparisons. I was able to import the data directly from Kaggle into a data frame, normalize keyword formatting, address data type inconsistencies, and append a column to the set containing the preprocessed data in a space separated string of keywords. Lastly, I used CountVectorizer to transform the dataset into a sparse matrix of keywords contained for each movie. </li><br>
          <li> This week: I plan to design the SQLite schema structure and to create the CRUD operations necessary for its operation. In the database I plan to store the metadata of the movies along with the keyword strings, as storing entire matrix rows is not feasible given their size and sparsity. I also plan to store a user watch history in the database.</li><br>
          <li>Obstacles: The main challenge will be time management. While I have experience with designing and implementing relational databases, as well as using libraries such as pymongo, but I am new to using sqlite3 and will need to familiarize myself with its syntax and behaviors. </li><br>
          <li>Work process: I will continue using long, focused blocks to progress through my tasks as this helped me make substantial progress last week. This strategy allows me to engross myself in the content and proves to be especially effective with the education portions, allowing for deeper engagement with the content. </li>
        </ul>
